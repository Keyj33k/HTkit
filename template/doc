Greetings!

Python is amazing. Your annoying daily tasks can be
automated with just a few lines of code. Because of this, I wanted
to combine some automation scripts to provide quick
access to different resources and not having to use more
console windows than necessary. In my personal opinion, a
good overview is essential for activities like penetration
testing etc.

Because of this, I want to make it easier for you to
expand this project with your automation scripts.
In this folder I have stored
a small template that you can use for your own Hunter
module to extend this toolkit. But that's not a must, if
you have your own idea/structure for a completely custom Hunter
module, feel free and use your idea to make the Hunter-Toolkit
better too!

NOTE: Please always check your code before you make it public.

Happy Hacking!
