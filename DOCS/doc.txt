What can Hunter Toolkit do for you?
-----------------------------------
    1) [Witcher] Simple port scanning.
    	∟► - This port scanner is using the transmittion
    	      control protocol for getting informations 
    	      from the target like: 
    	    	-> open ports
    	    	-> service behind open ports
    	    	BUT: - This is a SIMPLE port scanner for a quick check
    	    	     - For detailed informations it is recommendet to 
    	    	       use the nmap portscanner: "nmap --help"
    2) [MD5Crypt] MD5 encryption.
    	∟► - The message digest algorithm is a widley used hash function
    	      producing a 128bit hash value.
    	      It can't be decrypt, but bruteforced using this link:
    	    	∟► "https://www.md5online.org/md5-decrypt.html"
    3) [IPv4-lookup] IPv4 whois.
    	∟► - IPv4 whois will send a request to the ip-api.com api
    	      for getting informations about a given ipv4 address 
    	      like region, isp, lat, lon and more.
    	    - You can get some more informations using: 
    	      	∟► "https://github.com/Keyj33k/Hatake"
    4) [Banner-Grabber] Banner grabber.
    	∟► - Banner grabber using the transmission control protocol
    	      for getting informations about the service behind 
    	      a given port.
    5) [Phonenumber-Whois] Phonenumber whois.
    	∟► - With the phonenumber whois tool you can get informations
    	      like validation, the timezone, location and the provider.
    	    - It may helps for a social engineering attack.
    6) [Subdomain-Scanner] Subdomain scanner.
    	∟► - The subdomain scanner uses a wordlist for bruteforcing 
    	      a target site to tell the red teamer about possible
    	      subdomains.
    	    - You can easily choose your own wordlist by entering 
    	      the /path/to/wordlist or you can leave it empty 
    	      for the default wordlist
    7) [MySystem] System overview.
    	∟► - Sometimes it is necessery to know how much a cpu or ram is utilized
    	    - This function can give you informations about the most needed 
    	      system informations like disk, cpu or ram usage
    	    - Use "x" or ctrl+c to exit system overview or let the magic happen 
    	      by hitting the enter key  
    8) [Get-IPv4-from-URL] Get IPv4 from URL.
    	∟► - Easily get the ipv4 address from the given url
    	    - DESCRIPTION: Translate a host name to IPv4 address format. The IPv4 address is 
    	      returned as a string. If the host name is an IPv4 address itself it
    	      is returned unchanged. 
    9) [Password-Generator] Simple password generator.
    	∟► - This tool will help you to create a strong password
    	    - The password contains the following characters:
    	    	∟► "1234567890"
    	    	∟► "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    	    	∟► "ABVDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    	    	∟► "§$%&/()=}[{]?!_;:" 
    	    	(Some Websites will not allow some of
    	    	these characters, so you need to remove the invalid ones.)
    10) [Whois-lookup] URL whois.
    	∟► - Whois informations are important for a successfully information 
    	      gathering progress. So you can use this function for getting 
    	      some informations about any target. This toolkit uses a module called 
    	      python-whois which is an amazing (very)easy to use python module:
    	      	∟► "https://pypi.org/project/python-whois/"
    11) [Get-HTTP-Header] Get HTTP header.
    	∟► - Thanks to the curl tool: Let's combine it with python and the result is 
    	      a simple and easy to use automation tool for getting the http header 
    	      from any website
    	    - A header normally contains the status code, the service (version) and 
    	      the content type
    	    - Just enter the target url and curl will do the job for us
    12) [HREF-Collector] Collect href from html page.
    	∟► - Sometimes it is useful to know what href attributes a website contains
    	    - So we use the amazing request module: This function will send a 
    	      get request and the beautifulsoup4 module will evaluates the result and 
    	      will filter all the href attributes from the response. 
    13) [Ping-Request] Check host availability.
    	∟► - There are many reasons to check if the target host is available or not
    	    - Because this script using ping, we have detailed informations about the icmp 
    	      request. What would we do without ping
    14) [IPSweep] Check host range for active devices.
    	∟► - IPSweep is a famous kind of tools for checking if a host is live or not
    	    - Just enter the ipv4 address and this script will scan a range of possible
    	      ip addresses in the local network for the reachability
    15) [ExternalTools] Most used tools.
    	∟► - This toolkit was not written to replace other amazing tools. Hunter is 
    	      an ASSISTANT for penetration tests. Annoying tasks that you have 
    	      to repeat over and over again can be completed faster with this. For 
    	      this reason I have included links for quick access to other tools to this 
    	      toolkit, which I also use regularly:
